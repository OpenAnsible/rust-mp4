//! Contains the `Skip` and `Free` atoms, which are used to skip over data that is not needed.
//!
//! You can find the spec for these atoms in ISO/IEC 14496-12:2015 ยง 8.1.2.
//! These atoms are not recognized by this library, so they are just parsed and discarded.
//!
//! From the specification:
//!
//! _The contents of a free-space box are irrelevant and may be ignored, or the object deleted, without affecting the presentation.
//! (Care should be exercised when deleting the object, as this may invalidate the offsets used in the sample table,
//! unless this object is after all the media data)._
