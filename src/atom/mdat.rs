/// A presentation may contain zero or more Media Data Boxes.
/// The actual media data follows the type field; its structure is described by the metadata
/// (see particularly the sample table, subclause 8.5, and the item location box, subclause 8.11.3).
///
/// In large presentations, it may be desirable to have more data in this box than a 32-bit size would permit.
/// In this case, the large variant of the size field, above in subclause 4.2, is used.
///
/// There may be any number of these boxes in the file (including zero,
/// if all the media data is in other files).
/// The metadata refers to media data by its absolute offset within the file
/// (see subclause 8.7.5, the Chunk Offset Box); so Media Data Box headers
/// and free space may easily be skipped, and files without any box structure
/// may also be referenced and used.
