/// `Meta` contains descriptive or annotative metadata. It is used to provide information about
/// the media, or to associate other objects with the media.
///
/// The `Meta` box is required to contain a `Hdlr` box indicating the structure or format of the `Meta` box contents.
/// That metadata is located either within a box within this box (e.g. an `Xml` box), or is located by the item
/// identified by a primary item (`Pitm`) box.
///
/// All other contained boxes are specific to the format specified by the handler box.
///
/// The other boxes defined here may be defined as optional or mandatory for a given format.
/// If they are used, then they must take the form specified here.
/// These optional boxes include a data-information box, which documents other files in which metadata values
/// (e.g. pictures) are placed, and a item location box, which documents where in those files each item
/// is located (e.g. in the common case of multiple pictures stored in the same file).
/// At most one meta box may occur at each of the file level, movie level, or track level,
/// unless they are contained in an additional metadata container box (â€˜mecoâ€™).
///
/// If an Item Protection Box occurs, then some or all of the meta-data,
/// including possibly the primary resource,
/// may have been protected and be un-readable unless the protection system is taken into account.
///
/// - Box Type: `Meta`
/// - Container: File, Movie Box (`Moov`), Track Box (`Trak`), or Additional Metadata Container Box (`Meco`)
/// - Mandatory: No
/// - Quantity: Zero or one (in File, `Moov`, and `Trak`), One or more (in `Meco`)
